# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/
   - assets/images/
   - assets/images/doctor.jpg
   - assets/images/appointment.png
   - assets/images/reminder.png
   - assets/images/reports.png
   - assets/images/yourappointments.png
   - assets/animations/
   - assets/sound/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Sofiapro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sofiapro-Light.otf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sofiapro-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sofiapro-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sofiapro-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700

    - family: customIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/customIcons2.ttf
    - family: Ic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ic/ic_medicine.ttf
    - family: Angel
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/neu/Angel Signature.ttf
